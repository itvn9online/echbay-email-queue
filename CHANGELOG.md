# Changelog

## [1.2.3] - 2025-09-19

### Added

- **Cron Process Locking**: Implemented file-based lock mechanism to ensure only one cron process runs at a time
- **Smart Wait System**: Second cron process waits for first to complete instead of failing immediately
- **Lock Timeout Protection**: Automatic cleanup of stuck lock files after 2 minutes
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Lock files properly cleaned up on success, error, and timeout

### Technical Details

- **Lock File**: `emqm_cron_lock.txt` stores timestamp of running process
- **Wait Mechanism**: Up to 30 attempts Ã— 2 seconds = 60 seconds maximum wait time
- **Timeout Handling**: Lock files older than 120 seconds are automatically removed
- **Error Handling**: Lock cleanup in exception handlers prevents stuck locks

### Process Flow

1. **Check Existing Lock**: If lock file exists and is recent, wait for completion
2. **Create Lock**: Set lock file with current timestamp before processing
3. **Wait Logic**: Second process waits up to 60 seconds for first to complete
4. **Cleanup**: Lock file removed on successful completion, error, or timeout

### Benefits

- **No Race Conditions**: Prevents multiple cron jobs from processing same emails
- **Resource Protection**: Avoids server overload from concurrent email processing
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent email queue state
- **Graceful Handling**: Second process waits instead of failing immediately

### Lock File Behavior

- **Created**: When cron starts processing (if no `emqm_id` parameter)
- **Contains**: Unix timestamp of process start
- **Timeout**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **Cleanup**: Automatic on completion, error, or timeout

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-18

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-04

### Added

- **Statistics Caching**: Implemented caching for historical statistics that don't change
- **Cache Management**: Added `clear_stats_cache()` method for manual cache clearing
- **Performance Optimization**: Significantly reduced database queries for statistics

### Improved

- **Cached Statistics**:
  - `sent_yesterday`: Cached for 24 hours (86400 seconds)
  - `sent_last_week`: Cached for 7 days (604800 seconds)
  - `sent_last_month`: Cached for 30 days (2592000 seconds)
- **Database Performance**: Historical stats now load from cache instead of running expensive queries
- **Smart Cache Keys**: Date-specific cache keys ensure accurate data retrieval

### Technical Details

- Used WordPress transient API (`get_transient`, `set_transient`, `delete_transient`)
- Cache keys include date strings for uniqueness:
  - `emqm_sent_yesterday_2025-09-03`
  - `emqm_sent_last_week_2025-08-26`
  - `emqm_sent_last_month_2025-08`

- **Scalability**: Better performance on sites with large email queue history
- **Resource Usage**: Reduced server load during admin dashboard views
- **User Experience**: Faster loading of statistics dashboard

### Cache Behavior

- **Yesterday**: Cached permanently once the day is over
- **Last Week**: Cached permanently once the week (Monday-Sunday) is complete
- **Last Month**: Cached permanently once the month is over
- **Current Period**: Always fresh from database (not cached)

## [1.1.9] - 2025-09-04

### Fixed

- **Proper Week Boundaries**: Now correctly calculates "this week" and "last week" from Monday to Sunday

- Consistent use of `>=` and `<` operators for precise range queries

### Before vs After

**Before (Incorrect):**

- `sent_this_week`: Last 7 days from today
- `sent_last_week`: 14 days ago to 7 days ago

**After (Correct):**

- `sent_this_week`: Monday of current week to Sunday of current week
- `sent_last_week`: Monday of last week to Sunday of last week
